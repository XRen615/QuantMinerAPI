<p align="center"><big><b>Tool to analyze QuantMiner rule files "*.qmr"</b></big></p>

<BR>
You may progressively accumulate a large number of QuantMiner "*.qmr" rule files (see section on <a href="rules_format.htm"> the possible forms to save rules</a>). It may be difficult to remember from the file names their contents. <BR>
QuantMiner offers a tool that allows to remember the situation in which the rules were extracted for a given rule file, and gets from this file detailed information.
For this purpose use the menu "<i><b>Get information on a rule file</b></i>" from the menu "<i><b>Tools</b></i>".<BR>

<BR>
Note that this functionnality is independent of the wizard and can thus be used anytime and not necessarily during a mining process.<BR>
