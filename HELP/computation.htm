<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This window allows to follow online the progress in mining association rules (step by step). Note this does not appear when a set of rules is loaded.<BR>
<BR>
To start the process you have to clic on "<i>Start</i>". QuantMiner starts a set of computations that may be time-consuming. If it is the case, you can either stop the process anytime and keep only the rules computed so far, or let QuantMiner finish the process as a background task. 
QuantMiner will notify you when the computation is finished by a message and possibly a sound if the option is activated in <a href="parameter_setting.htm">QuantMiner parameters</a>.<BR>

<BR>
The top frame gives a summary of the context of extraction, including the parameters of the method used. It also gives all the process steps.<BR>
<BR>
The bottom frame presents the rules generated and kept by QuantMiner as interesting rules.<BR>
<BR>
In the middle, a progress bar shows the number of rules treated so far among the total number of rules to be computed. A fairly high number of rules to be computed may need your intervention to revise the parameters.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Warning</b>: The computation is initiated again each time you return to this step.
