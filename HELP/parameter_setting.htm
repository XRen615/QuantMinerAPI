<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In this panel, you can set some parameters of the software.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<b><i><u>GENERAL PARAMETERS:</u></i></b><BR><BR>
<b><i>User name</i></b>: give your name, or an identity to be contacted. This name will be written on all the generated rules files (it is possible to modify or complete it before saving). The files are not anonymous, which is an important feature for distribution and for retrieving the origin of the file.<BR>

<BR>
<b><i>Interface outlook</i></b>: Built in Java, the software has the classical, multi-platform characteristics, in order to be independent of the environment. Nevertheless, it is possible to choose the option corresponding to your system (Windows, for instance) so that the interface looks like your other applications. Modifying this option requires restarting the software.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<b><i><u> USERS PARAMETERS:</u></i></b><BR><BR>
<b><i>Warning of the end of the process</i></b>: Computing the association rules can be a long process, and therefore it is sometimes useful to run it in the background. Check this option to be warned when the process is ended: when a session of rules generation is finished, QuantMiner opens a windows, repeating a sound signal. <BR>
<BR>
<b><i>Sound file</i></b>: a path giving the location of the sound file to be played when a session of rules generation is finished (in case the previous option is activated). Only the Wave (*.wav) format is supported by QuantMiner.<BR>
