<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Simulated Annealing (SA) is a meta-heuristic search method,  as Genetic Algorithms (GA).
However, it is faster but it explores less the search space than its concurrent.<BR>
It is implemented in QuantMiner for sake of comparison; since SA is fast, it can help conducting preliminary experiments with a large number of attributes.<BR>
<BR>
SA works on many rule instantiations at the same time. It modifies the interval bounds w.r.t. a decreasing amplitude with iterations. At each iteration, if the quality of the rule (the same criterion as for GA) increases, it replaces the old rule by the new one.<BR>
<BR>
SA own parameters are as follows:


<ul>
<li> the <b>number of attempts to improve the rule</b>, </li>
<li> the <b>number of association rules to test simultaneously</b>, that is the number of instances on the <u>same</u> rule pattern that are processed independently but simultaneously. </li>
</ul>
Computation time depends on these parameters, as well as the quality of the results.
Note that the default values are large enough to improve quality.<BR>
