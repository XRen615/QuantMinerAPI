<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mining qualitative association rules with no numerical attribute is NOT QuantMiner specialty.<BR>
However, since the algorithms implemented in QuantMiner do use a  preliminary pruning of qualitative attributes using the state-of-the-art APRIORI algorithm, it becomes an implemented algorithm in QuantMiner that could be used if the user has no numerical attributes.<BR>
<BR>
Apriori works according to the method described in the section about <a href="association_rules.htm"> association rules</a>.<BR>
Its parameters are <b>minimum support and minimum confidence</b> thresholds that the rules must exceed to be considered strong rules and thus kept.<BR>
<BR>
Be aware not to use very low thresholds that risk to make the task intractable for QuantMiner and may produce a very large number of rules.<BR>
High thresholds are not good either since this may cut interesting rules.<BR>
