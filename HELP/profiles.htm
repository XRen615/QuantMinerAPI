<BR>
Data Mining is an iterative process and it is important to be able to retrieve all the context of a session.
Profiles allow storing information concerning the first three steps of the assistant, i.e.,  those preceding rules computation (Step 4). 
<BR>

<b><i><u>SAVING A PROFILE:</u></i></b><BR><BR>
Profiles are flexible: they can store information on all the steps, or on only a given step. 
Therefore, it is possible to store independently information concerning the three steps:<BR>
- <a href="pre_loading.htm"> the choice of the attributes to load from the database </a>,<BR>

- <a href="preextraction_english.htm"> the way attributes and their modalities appear in the rule schemes</a>,<BR>
- <a href="technical_setting.htm"> the choice of the datamining technique and the configuration of its parameters.</a> Let us note that each configuration of techniques can be stored independently from the others.<BR>

Depending on the step in the assistant, the command for saving a profile opens a panel, which offers the choice of the parameters to save through a set of boxes to check.
All combinations are possible, even incomplete ones. When loading, QuantMiner completes the parameters according to the context. <BR>
<BR>
It is important to give the profile files (*.prf) a name expressing their uses (especially the database to which they apply).<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<b><i><u>LOADING A PROFILE:</u></i></b><BR><BR>
<u>Whatever the first three steps</u> of the assistant the user is concerned, he/she can load a profile storing parameters for this step, or for another (previous or following) one. <BR>

It is possible to combine profiles, for instance using a first profile giving the choice of the attributes to load from the database and another one concerning the parameters of the genetic algorithm. <BR>

REMARK: It is possible to choose the parameters to save in a profile, but it is not possible to choose the parameters to load: all the parameters present in a file are used.
<BR>
<BR>
If the contents of the database has changed or if some parameters are not adapted, QuantMiner does its best to load the profile, taking into account the current situation.
