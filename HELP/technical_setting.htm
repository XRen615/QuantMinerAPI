<BR>
The third and last step in the parameter setting before starting the computation consists in choosing the mining technique.<BR>

<BR>
Three methods are proposed:<BR>
<BR>
- <a href="apriori_english.htm">Apriori</a>: this is the standard technique for mining association rules on categorical attributes only,<BR>

- <a href="genetic_algorithm.htm">Genetic Algorithm</a>: use this method when you have numerical attributes (of course, categorical attributes are not excluded),<BR>
- <a href="simulated_annealing.htm">Simulated annealing</a>: an alternative technique to Genetic Algorithm to handle numerical and categorical attributes, but note that this implementation is still experimental,<BR>
<br>
Moreover,<br>
- <a href="rules_loading.htm">Load a rule file</a>: a technique allowing to load a set of pre-computed rules generated with QuantMiner instead of starting over the computation.<BR>
