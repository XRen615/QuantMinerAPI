<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This functionnality is not a technique per se since it does not compute anything. It allows loading a file of rules computed by one of QuantMiner techniques along with the extraction context.<BR>
Thus, once validated, this technique skips the computation step to the visualization step of the rules in the file.
<BR>
A rule file has a specific QuantMiner format and has as extension "*.QMR".<BR>
For more information about this format, please see section <a href="rules_format.htm">on the different formats for saving the results</a>.<BR>
<BR>
Note that in order to load a rule file, you have to load first the dataset that served to extract the rules contained in this rule file. The name of the dataset can be easily found by using  <a href="rule_analysis.htm"> the tool that analyzes a rule file </a> present in QuantMiner.<BR>
